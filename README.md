# Simple_Python_Keylogger

This is a python project made by Anshul.

This is a simple 'KEYLOGGER' made in Python.
It uses 'pynput' library.

# WHAT IS A KEYLOGGER?

A keylogger is a computer program that records every keystroke made by a computer user,
especially in order to gain fraudulent access to passwords and other confidential information.

# WHAT IS "pynput"?

'pynput' is a library supported in Python language.
This library allows you to control and monitor input devices.
Currently, mouse and keyboard input and monitoring are supported.

# INSTRUCTIONS:-

>
>After the library is downloaded, open the python file and run it.

>Now in the terminal you can see all the keys that are presses by the user (after running the program).


PS:- as keylogger uses monitoring, windows can show security threats and warnings we need to allow it in order to make this program function.
